# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D7P1.py)

This one was surprisingly straight-forward.  A big assist from the dict comprehension with lambda sort to get me the lowest fuel number easily.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d6.go)

TBD

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D7P2.py)

The only thing to show off in this solution is the formula to calculate the fuel series:

```Python
>>> t = [1,2,3,4,5]
>>> for n in t:
	print(int(((1 + n)/2 ) * n))


1
3
6
10
15
```
Only works for all numbers guaranteed in a series, but it does what we needed.
