# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D10P1.py)

I saw the sample input and immediately got a bit of PTSD from an Edabit problem I got hung up on for days while learning Python.  Thankfully, I've grown a lot since then in my knowledge of data structures, which helped a lot here.

This one ended up being relatively smooth and straight forward.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D10P2.py)

The main gotcha for me on this one was my calculations for the score and then not properly reading what was expected for an answer.  I was beating my head against a wall for 10 minutes or so returning the sum of scores, rather than the middlemost score like they were actually asking for...

A very simple adaptation from my part 1 solve, though, since all of the part 1 logic could be used to filter out the "Corrupt" values which left us with incomplete values.  Based on the wording, I assumed all other values were incomplete, but I still put a logic check in just to make sure.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

We'll see.
