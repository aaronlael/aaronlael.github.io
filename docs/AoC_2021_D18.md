# [--- Day 18: Snailfish ---](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/18)
## or..
## I should have just committed to using strings from the get go.

# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D18P1.py)

I'm the reverse of what AoC expects for coding time.  I have no real time for focus on the weekend since there's no daycare!  I first got the idea that I should parse the string into a list, then a list of tuples containing the depth and value.  This actually worked pretty well until I got the very end and needed the "pairs" to calculate a score.  I spent the next day off and on tinkering with string parsing until my abomination would produce the right value.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D18P2.py)

This was fairly easy thanks to reading a bit and the itertools.combinations function.  I just had to create the "pairs" then mirror them to create the full list since:

> Note that snailfish addition is not commutative - that is, x + y and y + x can produce different results.

Which resulted in my mutated setup function:

```Python
def setupdata(data) -> list:
    data = data.split("\n")
    d = list(itertools.combinations(data, 2))
    d += [(x[1], x[0])for x in d]
    return d
```

I'm doing my best to use type hints on all of my functions.


## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

We'll see.
