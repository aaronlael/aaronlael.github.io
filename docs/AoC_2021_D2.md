# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D2P1.py)

This was a basic "do you even switch/case" bro type of problem, which I can appreciate because Python doesn't have a native switch/case syntax.
You either build a dict to facilitate your handling or you use if-elif (which is what I did because it's faster to implement).

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d2p1.go)

Unlike Python, Go has a switch/case syntax...I just had to review it in order to implement it successfully.  The best thing I learned was that the switch parameter was optional.
```go
default:
	fmt.Println("You dun goofed A-A-ron")
```
This is my common "error handling" in go at the moment.

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D2P2.py)

To quote screen rant "Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience".  This was the easiest part 2 I've ever done, I suspect.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d2p2.go)

I pretty much copy an pasted 95% of part 1 into this to solve part 2.  Really it was just tracking a new variable throughout the process.
