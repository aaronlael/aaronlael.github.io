# Part 1 and 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D6.py)

I learned my lesson from yesterday and immediately starting using a dict handling my state changes which paid off.  Since the part two problem was just an expansion on the number of iterations to make using a list to maintain state impractical (probably impossible).

This is a great place to remember deep vs shallow copy of dicts in python:

### Here is a deep copy example that keeps reference to the original dict

```python
>>> t
{'0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0, '6': 0, '7': 0, '8': 0}
>>> d = t
>>> d['1'] = 3
>>> t
{'0': 0, '1': 3, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0, '6': 0, '7': 0, '8': 0}
>>>
```
### ...and here's the shallow copy that creates a new copy, that is separate
```python
>>> t = {'0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0, '6': 0, '7': 0, '8': 0}
>>> d = t.copy()
>>> d['1'] = 3
>>> t
{'0': 0, '1': 0, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0, '6': 0, '7': 0, '8': 0}
>>> d
{'0': 0, '1': 3, '2': 0, '3': 0, '4': 0, '5': 0, '6': 0, '7': 0, '8': 0}
>>>
```
Watch out for Lanternfish!

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d6.go)

This was a fairly straight forward rip and replace from my Python solution.  I even found a bit of code that was redundant from that that I didn't need to include in my go program.  This was a good chance for me to get a better understanding of working with maps.
