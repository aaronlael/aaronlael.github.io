## or..
## Do not attempt to fold the paper, but the will of the paper.

# Part 1

Again, I sort of didn't read all the way to the intended answer and just started coding.  Again, it worked out ok.  From the beginning I started working on a folding agorithm using list slicing and pythons ability to easily reverse the order of lists to facilitate folds.

```Python
>>> t = [[".",",","#"],["#", ".", "."],[".", ".", "."],[".",",","#"],["#", ".", "."]]
>>> # the position of our symmetrical y fold
>>> yfoldat = 2
>>> # the top of our paper
>>> top = t[:yfoldat]
>>> # the bottom, reversed to facilitate the "fold up"
>>> bottom = t[yfoldat + 1:][::-1]
>>> # a quick set of loops to move the "#" from the bottom into the top
>>> for y in range(len(bottom)):
	for x in range(len(bottom[y])):
		if bottom[y][x] == "#":
			top[y][x] = "#"
>>> top
[['#', ',', '#'], ['#', '.', '#']]
```
The xfold is a little more compilcated because you need to using list slicing to get halve the inner lists of the multi dimensional list, but it wasn't that bad.

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D13.py)

The part that tripped me up was that the data was one less row than it needed to be if you definied it by the maximum y value.  This was because the folds all needed to be symmetrical, and that required a length 1 longer than the initial as definined by my logic from part 1.  After that, the "text" became readable.

We'll see.
