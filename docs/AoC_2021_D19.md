# [--- Day 19: Beacon Scanner ---](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/19)
## or..
## I have no idea what I'm doing and it is starting to effect my task performance

# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D19P1.py)

I surfed a lot of help guides on reddit for D19 P1 and found the only solution that made sense to me:
1. Make all 27 rotations for all scanners
2. offset a single point from a scanner onto a point of scanner 0
3. offset all the other points in the single canner by the same offset
4. check for 12 matches (set.intersection)
5. do that a lot...

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D19P2.py)

I banged my head against this for a long time.  The "bug" in my code was related to me adding coordinates to determine scanner positions vs subtracting them.  After a pen and paper style example from my friend [John](https://github.com/Nhawdge) and seeing a tip to turn the very basic 2 scanner 3 beacon test input into 3d coords by adding a ,0 after them and then testing scanner position against that; I got it.

It's done...

We'll see.
