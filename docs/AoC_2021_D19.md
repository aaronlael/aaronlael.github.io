## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D19P1.py)

I surfed a lot of help guides on reddit for D19 P1 and found the only solution that made sense to me:
1. Make all 27 rotations for all scanners
2. offset a single point from a scanner onto a point of scanner 0
3. offset all the other points in the single canner by the same offset
4. check for 12 matches (set.intersection)
5. do that a lot...

Eventually it returned the correct answer, but I'm not quite to the point of understanding how I can convert this into P2 successfully.

Still catching up
