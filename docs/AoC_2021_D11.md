# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D11P1.py)

I hit two major road blocks with this:  my while loop for "flashing" octopuses was terminating prematurely and when I was "flashing" I was accidentally rolling 0s to 1s that hadn't flashed yet.

Once I took a little advice from [Chris](https://github.com/cjwahl), who I was chatting with on discord for our friendgroups regular game night ([Astroneer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/) tonight, pretty fun game if you like running out of oxygen in a deep cave because your friend [John](https://github.com/nhawdge) breaks your tether line.), I was able to correct my while exit condition and got part 1 solved.

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D11P2.py)

It took me all of 30 seconds to refactor my part 1 solution for part 2.  Rather than tracking cumulative flashes, I just tracked flashes after each "step" until there were 100 flashes.  Easy peasy, decent performance at 0.04 seconds.

We'll see.
