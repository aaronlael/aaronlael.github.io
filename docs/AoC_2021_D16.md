# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D16P1.py)

This one was a reading challenge more than anything else, but it was also a good use case for my to try recursive programming.  I had always been somewhat resistant to this concept because outside of calculating the fibbionaci sequence, I couldn't grasp any real world examples.

This one clicked and I was able to pull it off fairly easily.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D16P2.py)

This one was a fairly straight forward adaptation of my part 1.  Just make it track the value of literals and perform the operations.  The problem was that I had a reading comprehension issue.  I swallowed my pride and asked reddit for help and thankfully [a user spotted my reading error setting up for the problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/rhxtwt/comment/hotia0u/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and it was very easy to fix.

I like these binary puzzles that don't require bitwise.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

We'll see.
