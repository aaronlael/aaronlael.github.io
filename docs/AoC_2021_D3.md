## or..
## I've had enough trauma in my life without having to learn bitwise operators, ok...
![one art please](/docs/assets/img/guages.png)
# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D3P1.py)

I later realized I was doubling up on the "work" of maintaing the data since epsilon was just a mirrored gamma, I could have just flipped the bits.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d3p1.go)

In my Go version of this solution, I did just flip the bits to get epsilon, but I still didn't use a bitwise operator to do it.  
Someday I'll learn how to properly use bitwise not.
```go
func flipstring(val string) (string, error) {
	var out string
	for _, x := range strings.Split(val, "") {
		if x == "0" {
			out += "1"
		} else {
			out += "0"
		}
	}
	return out, nil
}```

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D3P2.py)

The change from the problem in part 1 to the problem in part 2 was interesting.  
Python really felt like the right tool for this because of how fast it is to write loops with list comprehensions.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d3p2.go)

I'm starting to get more concerned with the "boiler plate" feel of Go in these challenges, but I think that it's not fair to frame them against Python.
Looking at some of these in comparison to my friend John's C# solutions, I don't feel as bad about writing so much.
