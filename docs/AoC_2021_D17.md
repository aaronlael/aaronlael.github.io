# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D17P1.py)

After yesterday's reading mishap, I knew it was worth it to have coffee before reading the problem.  I felt like I grasped it, and eventually came up with some logical constraints for the initial velocity.  I feel like this was a straight forward solution that just took me a bit to wrap my mind around.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D17P2.py)

I thought I had read the problem, but alas, I apparently misread one part:

> For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that causes it to be within a target area after any step.

There was a part immediately before this that specified that the x move happened before the y, so I had figured this meant that mid-step traversing the goal would count.  It very much did not.  After sorting that out, I had a trivial off by one error caused by my x range not including the max value which took me a few seconds to sort out then 3 seconds of execution time and we had a bingo.

We'll see.
