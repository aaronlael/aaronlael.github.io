# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D14P1.py)

I brute forced this by creating a string.  Not a great or sustainable method, but it was quick.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D14P2.py)

This required me to think like the Lanternfish puzzle:  you don't care about individuals, you care about what is happening to individuals.

I ended up creating a dict to track how many of each "pair" of letters existed each day, and used that to "grow" the new 2 pairs from each the next day.  This worked very well, but then took me a bit to figure out the logic to calculate the count of individual letters because everything repeats twice in the dict except the very first and last character.  Then I realized those never change because we're inserting into the middle and that's a bingo.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

We'll see.
