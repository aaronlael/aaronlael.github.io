# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D20.py)

I thought I had this one in the bag.  Create your lookaround function, pad the whole data set with 2 rows/columns of "." and Bob's your uncle: solved.

NOPE.

I ended up padding my data with 200 rows/columns of blanks then trimming off 50 rows/columns from each side to get my final "masterpiece".  

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

Still catching up

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D20.py)

My solution from P1 just expanded the border space from P1, which still worked for P1.  Really, not a difficult challenge if you were willing to look at your printed output to see what was happening.


## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/)

We'll see.
