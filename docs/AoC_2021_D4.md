# [--- Day 4: Giant Squid ---](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)
## or..
## I've only watched episode one of Squid Game, no spoilers please...

# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D4P1.py)

I feel like this just took me too long to get all of the moving parts to cooperate, but once I had
everything lined up, returned from the bakery with my daughter (and some fresh donuts) I was able to
finish it easily enough.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d4.go)

This took me a lot longer that I'd like to admit to finish.  I actually wrapped this up on day 6 even thought I had a viable Python solution on day 4.  My big takeaways are that in Go, a lot of the things I take from granted simply do not exist.

Want to check for equality between two slices? (of slices of slices...) => write a function

Want to count a specific value in a slice? => write a function

Want to remove an element from a slice by element? => you guessed it, write a function.

Here's a funny bit my friend [John](https://github.com/Nhawdge) sent me to (I assume) brighten my spirits:


> this isssssss<br>
a story of a girrrrl<br>
who tried to cry and drown the whole world, but she got caught up having to write her own cry function

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D4P2.py)

I banged my head against this for too long.  I ended up re-using most of part 1, which also caused me to go back and refactor part one because I ignored a few edge cases (two boards receiving a bingo on the same turn, namely).  I also made the mistake of trying to assign an in place operator (list.remove()) which generated a heap of nonetypes that I had to track down.

## [Go](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021-Go/blob/master/aoc_2021_d4.go)

See part 1 :).
