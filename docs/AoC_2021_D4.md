# [--- Day 4: Giant Squid ---](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4)
## or..
## I've only watched episode one of Squid Game, no spoilers please...

# Part 1

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D4P1.py)

I feel like this just took me too long to get all of the moving parts to cooperate, but once I had
everything lined up, returned from the bakery with my daughter (and some fresh donuts) I was able to
finish it easily enough.

## [Go](pending)

To be done this afternoon, probably.

# Part 2

## [Python](https://github.com/aaronlael/AoC-2021/blob/master/AoC_2021_D4P2.py)

I banged my head against this for too long.  I ended up re-using most of part 1, which also caused me to go back and refactor part one because I ignored a few edge cases (two boards receiving a bingo on the same turn, namely).  I also made the mistake of trying to assign an in place operator (list.remove()) which generated a heap of nonetypes that I had to track down.

## [Go](pending)

To be done this afternoon, probably.
