# Advent of Code 2021:  An adventure in Python...then Go
![one art please](/docs/assets/img/python_vs_go.png)

## Goal for the year

This year my goal is to get as far as I can get using Python.  Once I have a suitable Python
solution, rather than going back an working on optimizing an tidying, I will be rewriting the solution
in Go to further my knowledge in that language.

### Showing your work

I know for a fact that [John](https://github.com/Nhawdge) will steal my code just like he steals my T.K.O drawings to make shirts, but I won't let him cyber bully me.  Actually, I did let him cyber bully me into some sense...no reason to have my repo as private when there's an entire wealth of better solutions on reddit every day.

You can go [here](docs/AoC_2021.md) to see a short daily post about each day that I complete with some of my takeways from the challenges themselves along with cramming my Python solutions into Go shaped boxes.

Happy Holidays!
