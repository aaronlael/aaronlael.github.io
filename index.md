# Advent of Code 2021:  An adventure in Python...then Go
![one art please](/aaronlael.github.io/assets/python_vs_go.png)

## Goal for the year

This year my goal is to get as far as I can get using Python.  Once I have a suitable Python
solution, rather than going back an working on optimizing an tidying, I will be rewriting the solution
in Go to further my knowledge in that language.

### Showing your work

Since this is an active challenge, I feel like it goes against the spirit of things to publicly post solutions to github until after the challenge has closed. I know for a fact that [John](https://github.com/Nhawdge) will steal my code just like he steals my T.K.O drawings to make shirts.

You can go [here](https://aaronlael.github.io/2021/) to see a short daily post about each day that I complete with some of my takeways from the challenges themselves along with cramming my Python solutions into Go shaped boxes.

Happy Holidays!
