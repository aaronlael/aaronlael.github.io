# Advent of Code 2021:  An adventure in Python...then Go

## Goal for the year

This year my goal is to get as far as I can get using Python.  Once I have a suitable Python
solution, rather than going back an working on optimizing an tidying, I will be rewriting the solution
in Go to further my knowledge in that language.

Happy Holidays!
